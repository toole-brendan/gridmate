## Frontend Architecture Recommendations (Simplified for MVP)

### Current Structure Analysis
The project currently has mixed frontend code within the `src/` directory:
- Electron desktop app code (unnecessary for MVP)
- Excel Add-in code (core product)
- Shared components between both

### Recommended MVP Structure
