# Gridmate Excel Add-in: UI Styling Guide

## 1. Core Philosophy

The user interface for the Gridmate Excel add-in is designed to be **clean, sharp, and professional**. The aesthetic is heavily inspired by **iOS design principles**, prioritizing clarity, ease of use, and a minimalist feel that allows the user to focus on their financial modeling tasks without distraction. The overall look is light and airy, with a structured layout that feels both modern and precise.

## 2. Color Palette

The application uses a **light-themed color palette** with high contrast to ensure readability.

-   **Backgrounds:** The primary app background is a soft, off-white (`#FAFAFA`), with pure white (`#FFFFFF`) used for card elements and modal surfaces to create a subtle sense of depth.
-   **Text:** Text colors are shades of black and gray, with pure black for primary content, dark gray for secondary information, and lighter gray for tertiary details and placeholders.
-   **Accent Color:** A vibrant **iOS blue** (`#007AFF`) is used as the primary accent color for all interactive elements, including buttons, links, and active state indicators.
-   **Functional Colors:** Standard, high-visibility colors are used for system feedback: green for success, red for errors or destructive actions, and orange for warnings.

## 3. Typography

The typography is based on Apple's native font stacks to ensure a seamless experience on macOS and a clean, modern look on other platforms.

-   **Primary Font:** The main font is **SF Pro** (or its system-font equivalents), known for its excellent readability at all sizes.
-   **Font Size:** The overall font size is kept relatively small to maintain a high information density suitable for a professional tool.
-   **Hierarchy:** A clear typographic scale is used to differentiate between titles, body text, subheadings, and captions, creating a scannable and intuitive visual hierarchy.

## 4. Layout & Spacing

The layout is structured and uncluttered, making extensive use of **whitespace** to guide the user's eye and prevent the interface from feeling cramped. Padding within containers is consistent and follows a defined spacing system.

## 5. Shape & Form

-   **Corners:** The UI employs **sharp, precise corners**. Most elements have a minimal border-radius (e.g., 4px) or are perfectly sharp, contributing to the professional, "military-style" aesthetic. Soft, rounded shapes are avoided.
-   **Borders:** Thin, light-gray borders are used to subtly define the edges of cards, inputs, and other containers, providing structure without adding visual noise.

## 6. Elevation & Shadow

Shadows are used sparingly and with subtlety to create a sense of depth and elevate interactive elements from the background. The shadows are soft and diffuse, mimicking the natural depth found in iOS interfaces, rather than being heavy or dark.

## 7. Micro-interactions & Animation

Animations are **fast, subtle, and purposeful**. They are used to provide immediate feedback for user actions, such as button clicks or content loading. Transitions are typically quick (150-300ms) to ensure the interface feels responsive and snappy, never sluggish.

## 8. Component Styling

-   **Buttons:** Primary action buttons are filled with the blue accent color, featuring sharp corners and clear, concise labels.
-   **Cards:** Cards are the primary surface for content. They have a white background, sharp corners, a subtle border, and a light shadow to lift them off the page.
-   **Filter Chips:** Used for contextual information, these chips are small, sharp-cornered tags with a light background and uppercase, medium-weight text, giving them a distinct, functional appearance.
