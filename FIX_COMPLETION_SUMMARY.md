# Fix Summary: Completion Callback Timing Issue

## Changes Made

### 1. **Pre-registered Completion Callback** (`signalr_handler.go`)
- Moved callback registration to line 90-152 (BEFORE AI processing)
- This ensures the callback is ready when operations complete
- Added tracking with `callbackRegistered` flag

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Registration**
- Removed the duplicate callback registration that was happening after AI processing
- Replaced with cleanup logic if no operations were queued

### 3. **Added Callback Cleanup Method** (`queued_operations.go`)
- Added `UnregisterMessageCompletionCallback()` method
- Allows safe removal of callbacks when not needed
- Prevents memory leaks from unused callbacks

## How This Fixes the Issue

**Before:**
1. AI processes message and queues operations
2. Operations start executing (some complete quickly)
3. Callback gets registered (TOO LATE!)
4. Last operation completes but callback might be missing
5. System waits forever for completion signal

**After:**
1. Callback gets registered FIRST
2. AI processes message and queues operations
3. Operations execute and complete
4. Callback is guaranteed to be available
5. Completion message is sent properly
6. Chat continues working normally

## Key Benefits

1. **No Race Condition**: Callback exists before any operation can complete
2. **Proper Cleanup**: Unused callbacks are removed if no operations queued
3. **Graceful Handling**: System logs warnings but doesn't freeze if issues occur
4. **Consistent Flow**: All operations complete → callback fires → completion message sent

## Testing Instructions

To test the fix:
1. Rebuild the backend: `cd backend && go build`
2. Start the application
3. Create a chat request that generates multiple tool calls (e.g., "Create a DCF model")
4. Approve all diff previews one by one
5. Verify the chat shows completion message after last approval
6. Verify you can send another message without freezing

## Expected Logs

You should see:
- "Pre-registered completion callback before AI processing"
- "All operations completed, sending final AI response"
- NO "No completion callback registered for completed message" warnings

The app should no longer freeze after approving the last diff preview!
