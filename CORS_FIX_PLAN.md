## 1. Objective

Resolve the critical connection failure between the React frontend and the .NET SignalR backend. The goal is to correctly configure the backend's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy to permit requests from the frontend development server, eliminating the "access control checks" error.

## 2. Problem Analysis

The debug logs provided contain the following key error:
`Fetch API cannot load https://localhost:7171/hub/negotiate?negotiateVersion=1 due to access control checks.`

This error occurs because of the browser's Same-Origin Policy. The frontend, running on `https://localhost:3000`, is attempting to make a request to the backend on a different origin, `https://localhost:7171`. The browser blocks this request by default unless the backend explicitly signals its permission via specific HTTP headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).

The previous refactoring successfully migrated the backend to HTTPS but did not include the necessary CORS policy updates to allow the frontend's origin. This plan will add that missing configuration.

## 3. Implementation Plan

The fix involves modifying the .NET SignalR application's startup configuration to define and apply a CORS policy that trusts the frontend development environment.

### 3.1. Affected File

*   **File to Modify:** `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/signalr-service/GridmateSignalR/Program.cs`

### 3.2. Implementation Steps

We will modify `Program.cs` in two places: first to register the CORS services and define the policy, and second to add the CORS middleware to the application's request pipeline.

**Step 1: Register and Configure the CORS Policy**

Add the following code to `Program.cs` after the `builder.Services.AddSignalR();` line. This defines a policy named "AllowSpecificOrigin" that allows our frontend to connect.

```csharp
// Add CORS services
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowSpecificOrigin",
        builder =>
        {
            builder.WithOrigins("https://localhost:3000") // The origin of the React dev server
                   .AllowAnyHeader()
                   .AllowAnyMethod()
                   .AllowCredentials(); // Important for SignalR
        });
});
```

**Step 2: Apply the CORS Middleware**

Add the following line of code *before* the `app.UseAuthorization();` and `app.MapHub<GridmateHub>("/hub");` lines. The order is important; the CORS middleware must execute early in the pipeline.

```csharp
// Use the configured CORS policy
app.UseCors("AllowSpecificOrigin");
```

## 4. Verification Plan

After implementing the changes, the following steps will be taken to verify the fix:

1.  **Restart Backend:** Shut down and restart the .NET SignalR service to ensure the new configuration in `Program.cs` is loaded.
2.  **Restart Frontend:** Close the Excel add-in and restart the frontend development server (`npm start` or equivalent).
3.  **Observe Behavior:**
    *   The UI should load without connection errors.
    *   The "Connection" status in the debug panel should change to `connected`.
    .
4.  **Check Console Logs:** Open the browser's developer console (via the Safari Web Inspector for the Excel add-in) and confirm that:
    *   The `access control checks` and `Failed to complete negotiation` errors are no longer present.
    *   A successful SignalR connection message appears.

This plan will re-establish the connection, unblocking all further development and testing of the live visual diff feature.
