# Streaming Implementation Test Results

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong Backend URL**
- **Issue**: The Excel add-in was trying to connect to the SignalR service (port 7171) for streaming instead of the Go backend (port 8080)
- **Fix**: Updated `SignalRClient.ts` to use the correct streaming URL: `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. **CORS Configuration**
- **Issue**: The backend CORS configuration didn't include all necessary origins
- **Fix**: Added all required origins to CORS allowed list
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate CORS headers in streaming handler

### 3. **Authentication**
- **Issue**: EventSource doesn't support custom headers for authentication
- **Fix**: Added token as query parameter for streaming requests
- **Fix**: Added token validation in streaming handler

### 4. **Missing AI Provider**
- **Issue**: No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was set, causing the AI service to fail
- **Fix**: Created a mock AI provider for development testing
- **Fix**: Set default provider to "mock" for development

## How to Test

1. **Start the backend services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Go Backend
   cd backend
   go run cmd/api/main.go
   
   # Terminal 2 - SignalR Service
   cd signalr-service/GridmateSignalR
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Start the Excel add-in**:
   ```bash
   cd excel-addin
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test streaming**:
   - Open Excel with the add-in
   - Type a message like "Please make DCF model in this sheet, use mock data"
   - You should see:
     - Streaming text appearing character by character
     - Tool usage indicators when tools are called
     - Proper completion when done

## Expected Behavior

With the mock provider, you should see:
1. Gradual text streaming: "I'll help you create a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model with mock data..."
2. Tool indicators showing "write_range" being called
3. Progress updates during tool execution
4. Final completion message

## Configuration

To use a real AI provider instead of mock:
1. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Set `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` environment variable
3. Restart the backend service

## Debugging

If streaming still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Check backend logs for streaming request details
3. Verify all services are running on correct ports
4. Ensure CORS is properly configured
