## Conclusion

This MVP plan focuses on delivering immediate value to financial analysts by:
1. **Integrating seamlessly** with their existing Excel workflow
2. **Understanding context** better than any current solution
3. **Providing control** through human-in-the-loop design
4. **Showing clear value** in time savings and accuracy

The phased approach ensures we can validate each assumption before moving to the next phase, while the focus on the four key principles from successful AI apps (context, orchestration, UI, autonomy) guides every decision.

**Target: Functional MVP in 4-6 weeks that financial analysts actually want to use daily.**
