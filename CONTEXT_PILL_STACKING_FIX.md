# Context Pill Stacking Fix Plan

## Problem Statement
The UI currently has "recently edited" pills that are stacking or overlapping with other UI elements. Instead of repositioning these pills, we need to completely remove them from the UI.

## Solution Overview
Remove the "recently edited" pills entirely from the UI rather than attempting to reposition or reorganize them.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Identify Recently Edited Pills Components
- Locate all components that render "recently edited" pills
- Find their parent containers and any associated state management
- Identify any event handlers or listeners that trigger their display

### 2. Remove UI Components
- Delete or comment out the JSX/TSX code that renders recently edited pills
- Remove any CSS/styling specific to these pills
- Clean up any animations or transitions related to these pills

### 3. Clean Up State Management
- Remove state variables that track recently edited items for pill display
- Remove any Redux actions/reducers or context providers related to these pills
- Clean up any local component state used for these pills

### 4. Remove Event Handlers
- Remove event listeners that trigger the display of recently edited pills
- Remove any file system watchers or other mechanisms that populate these pills
- Clean up any API calls that fetch recently edited data for pill display

### 5. Update Layout
- Adjust spacing and layout of remaining UI elements
- Ensure no empty containers or gaps are left where pills were removed
- Test responsive behavior after removal

### 6. Clean Up Dead Code
- Remove any utility functions specific to recently edited pills
- Remove any types/interfaces used only for these pills
- Remove any tests specific to these pills

## Files Likely to be Modified
- Components that render pills (likely in a Pills, Tags, or similar directory)
- State management files (Redux store, Context providers)
- CSS/SCSS files for pill styling
- Layout components that contained these pills
- Any configuration files that enabled/disabled these pills

## Testing Approach
1. Verify pills no longer appear in the UI
2. Check that no console errors occur from removed code
3. Ensure layout looks correct without the pills
4. Test that file editing still works normally without pill updates
5. Verify no performance impact from removal

## Success Criteria
- Recently edited pills are completely removed from the UI
- No visual artifacts or layout issues after removal
- No console errors or warnings
- Application continues to function normally without these pills
