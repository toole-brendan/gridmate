# Tool Use Fix Summary

## Issue
Excel add-in tool requests were timing out - the backend was sending tool requests to the correct WebSocket client, but the Excel add-in wasn't receiving or processing them.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Problems Identified:
1. Session ID format mismatch between frontend and backend
2. WebSocket routing was using the wrong session ID
3. Frontend wasn't receiving tool_request messages properly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend WebSocket Hub Fix
**File**: `backend/internal/websocket/hub.go`

Fixed the session ID routing issue where the hub was incorrectly using the client ID as the session ID:

```go
// Before (incorrect):
sessionID := clientID  

// After (correct):
sessionID := msg.SessionID
```

This ensures tool requests are routed to the correct WebSocket client based on the actual session ID from the chat message.

### 2. Frontend Debugging Enhancements
**File**: `excel-addin/src/components/chat/ChatInterfaceWithBackend.tsx`

Added comprehensive debugging features:
- Visual debug panel showing connection status, API availability, and tool request status
- Added tool_request event listener for both generic and specific events
- Enhanced error logging and display
- Added test button to verify Excel API functionality

Key additions:
- `lastToolRequest` state to track tool requests
- `toolError` state to display errors
- Debug info panel with real-time status updates
- Office.js and Excel API availability checks

### 3. Excel Service Error Handling
**File**: `excel-addin/src/services/excel/ExcelService.ts`

Enhanced error handling and logging:
- Added checks for Excel API availability before execution
- Added detailed logging at each step of tool execution
- Wrapped tool execution in try-catch for better error reporting

## Current Status

The WebSocket routing is now working correctly:
- ✅ Backend correctly routes tool requests to the right client
- ✅ Frontend receives tool_request messages
- ✅ Office.js and Excel API are available in the add-in
- ⚠️ Tool execution still times out (needs further investigation)

## Next Steps

1. Test the Excel API directly using the test button added to the debug panel
2. Investigate why Excel.run() might be hanging or failing silently
3. Consider adding timeout handling within the Excel.run() execution
4. Check if there are any Excel-specific permissions or initialization issues

## Key Learnings

1. **Session ID Management**: Ensure consistent session ID format and usage across frontend and backend
2. **WebSocket Routing**: Always use the correct identifier (session ID, not client ID) for message routing
3. **Debugging Tools**: Visual debugging aids are crucial for diagnosing issues in embedded environments like Excel add-ins
4. **Office.js Context**: Excel API calls only work when the add-in is running inside Excel, not in a browser

## Files Modified

1. `backend/internal/websocket/hub.go` - Fixed session ID routing
2. `excel-addin/src/components/chat/ChatInterfaceWithBackend.tsx` - Added debugging UI and error handling
3. `excel-addin/src/services/excel/ExcelService.ts` - Enhanced logging and error handling
