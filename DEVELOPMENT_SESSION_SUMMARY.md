# Gridmate Development Session Summary
*Date: July 12, 2025*

## Overview
This session focused on getting the Gridmate Excel add-in fully functional with WebSocket connectivity, AI integration with Claude, and implementing direct Excel modification capabilities similar to Cursor's code editing features.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Connection Issues

#### Problem
- Excel add-in couldn't connect to backend WebSocket server
- Security issues with mixed content (HTTPS frontend, WS backend)
- React state not updating despite successful connections

#### Solutions Implemented
- **Fixed CORS configuration** (`backend/cmd/api/main.go`):
  - Updated `getEnvAsSlice` function to properly parse comma-separated CORS origins
  - Added string parsing with trimming to handle multiple origins correctly
  
- **Added request logging middleware** for debugging incoming connections

- **Implemented WebSocket proxy** (`excel-addin/vite.config.ts`):
  - Added proxy configuration to route WebSocket through HTTPS
  - Resolved mixed content security issues in Excel environment
  
- **Fixed WebSocket URL** (`excel-addin/src/components/chat/ChatInterfaceWithBackend.tsx`):
  - Changed from `ws://localhost:8080/ws` to use same host as frontend
  - Now connects via `wss://localhost:3000/ws` which proxies to backend

### 2. Resolved Backend Stability Issues

#### Problem
- Backend crashed when Excel add-in disconnected
- Panic: "repeated read on failed websocket connection"

#### Solution
- **Fixed WebSocket client error handling** (`backend/internal/websocket/client.go`):
  - Changed `break` to `return` in readPump error handling
  - Prevents attempting to read from closed connections

### 3. Fixed UI State Management Issues

#### Problem
- Connection status showed "connecting" even when connected
- Input field losing focus due to frequent re-renders
- White text on white background in chat input

#### Solutions
- **Removed aggressive re-rendering**:
  - Moved `renderKey` from main div to status bar only
  - Reduced periodic check frequency from 1s to 5s
  - Only update render key when status actually changes
  
- **Fixed chat input styling** (`excel-addin/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`):
  - Added explicit color classes: `text-gray-900 bg-white placeholder-gray-400`
  - Added debug logging for keyboard and button events

- **Used direct WebSocket state checking**:
  - Created `displayStatus` that checks actual WebSocket readyState
  - Bypasses React state update issues

### 4. Implemented Authentication Flow

#### Problem
- Backend required authentication before processing messages
- Chat messages were being rejected with "auth_required"

#### Solution
- **Added automatic authentication** on WebSocket connect:
  - Sends auth token immediately after connection
  - Uses development token for now
  - Added handlers for auth_success/auth_error responses

### 5. Connected AI Service to Anthropic Claude

#### Problem
- Backend was only echoing messages back
- AI service wasn't being used for chat responses

#### Solutions
- **Updated chat message handler** (`backend/internal/websocket/client.go`):
  - Routes messages through ExcelBridge service
  - ExcelBridge uses AI service for processing
  
- **Verified AI configuration**:
  - Anthropic API key loaded from environment
  - Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
  - Specialized financial modeling system prompt already configured

### 6. Implemented Direct Excel Modification (Like Cursor)

#### Problem
- Claude could only provide instructions, not directly modify Excel
- Users had to manually implement all suggestions

#### Solutions

##### Backend Changes
- **Enhanced AI system prompt** (`backend/internal/services/ai/prompt_builder.go`):
  - Added instructions for generating structured ACTION blocks
  - Defined format for cell_update and formula_update actions
  - Examples of DCF model creation with specific ranges and formulas

- **Implemented action parsing** (`backend/internal/services/ai/anthropic.go`):
  - Parses ACTION blocks from Claude's responses
  - Extracts type, range, values, formulas, and descriptions
  - Converts to structured action objects

##### Frontend Changes
- **Created ActionPreview component** (`excel-addin/src/components/actions/ActionPreview.tsx`):
  - Displays proposed changes with checkboxes
  - Apply/Reject buttons for user control
  - Shows confidence levels and descriptions
  - Executes changes using ExcelService

- **Integrated action handling** in ChatInterfaceWithBackend:
  - Detects actions in chat responses
  - Shows ActionPreview panel when actions are available
  - Sends approve/reject messages back to backend
  - Displays confirmation when changes are applied

- **ExcelService capabilities** (already existed):
  - `writeRange()` - Write values to cell ranges
  - `applyFormula()` - Apply formulas to cells
  - `readRange()` - Read current cell values
  - Full Office.js API integration

## Current Status

### Working Features
✅ Excel add-in loads and displays in Excel sidebar  
✅ WebSocket connection established over secure HTTPS proxy  
✅ Authentication flow with backend  
✅ Chat messages sent to Anthropic Claude API  
✅ Claude responds with financial modeling expertise  
✅ Direct Excel modification through action system  
✅ Preview and approval workflow for changes  

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript Excel add-in
- **Backend**: Go server with WebSocket support
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet via API
- **Database**: Azure PostgreSQL
- **Security**: HTTPS/WSS with proxy, JWT auth

## Latest Feature: Direct Excel Modifications

The most recent work implemented the ability for Claude to directly modify Excel sheets through a preview/apply system similar to how Cursor handles code changes:

1. **User asks**: "Create a DCF model in this spreadsheet"
2. **Claude generates**: Structured actions with specific ranges, values, and formulas
3. **UI shows**: Preview panel with checkboxes for each proposed change
4. **User reviews**: Can select/deselect specific changes
5. **One click**: Applies all selected changes directly to Excel

This transforms Gridmate from a chat assistant into a true Excel automation tool, allowing complex financial models to be generated and modified through natural language commands.

### Example Actions Generated:
```
ACTION: cell_update
RANGE: A1:A10
VALUES: ["DCF Model", "", "Revenue", "COGS", "Gross Profit", "Operating Expenses", "EBIT", "Tax", "NOPAT", ""]

ACTION: formula_update
RANGE: B5
FORMULA: =B3-B4
DESCRIPTION: Gross Profit calculation (Revenue - COGS)
```

Users can now build entire financial models through conversation, with Claude generating the appropriate Excel formulas and structure automatically.
