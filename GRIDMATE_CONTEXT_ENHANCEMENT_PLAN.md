## Recent Progress (December 2024)

### Phase 4: Backend Processing - COMPLETED âœ…
Successfully implemented all backend processing enhancements:
- **Rich Edit Tracking**: Capture old values and formulas before write operations
- **Session Context Updates**: Store edit history with full before/after values
- **Excel Context Integration**: Parse recentEdits from frontend with old/new value arrays
- **Full Sheet Processing**: Backend now properly handles fullSheetData from Excel context
- **Context Refresh**: AI awareness expands after edits through range merging

### Phase 5: Auto-Populate Context Pills - COMPLETED âœ…
Implemented intelligent context pill population:
- **Automatic Population**: Recent AI edits automatically appear as context pills
- **Significant Change Detection**: Identifies and highlights cells with >10% numeric changes
- **Enhanced UI**: Added custom icons for 'edit' and 'change' context types
- **Real-time Updates**: Context pills refresh when AI completes generating
- **Metadata Support**: Context items now support additional metadata for richer information

### Key Technical Improvements
1. **Frontend Changes**:
   - ExcelService tracks recent edits with old/new values in local array
   - ComprehensiveContext interface includes recentEdits field
   - Context pills auto-populate based on edit significance
   
2. **Backend Changes**:
   - Excel bridge properly extracts data from nested excelContext structure
   - Context builder processes full sheet data when available
   - Edit tracking information flows through tool execution pipeline

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Frontend captures edits â†’ stores in recentEdits array â†’ sends to backend
   - Backend parses edits â†’ includes in AI context â†’ AI sees complete history
   - AI makes informed decisions based on full spreadsheet state and change history

This document presents a comprehensive plan to transform Gridmate's Excel context handling system. By implementing these changes, the AI will have complete awareness of spreadsheet state, track all changes intelligently, and operate autonomously without requiring manual range selection.

## Executive Summary

The current context system has critical limitations:
- AI gets "stuck" editing the same cells due to limited context visibility
- Context is disabled by default, leaving AI blind to spreadsheet data
- Heavy reliance on manual cell selection creates unnatural interactions
- Poor tracking of changes (both user and AI initiated)
- Structure mismatch between frontend and backend context data

This plan addresses all these issues through a phased implementation approach.
