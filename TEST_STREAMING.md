# Streaming Implementation Test Plan

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented streaming support for GridMate's chat interface. Here's what was added:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Streaming Handler** (`backend/internal/handlers/streaming.go`) - New SSE endpoint for streaming
2. **Excel Bridge** - Added `ProcessChatMessageStreaming` method
3. **AI Service** - Added `ProcessChatWithToolsAndHistoryStreaming` method
4. **Routes** - Added `/api/chat/stream` endpoint

### Frontend Changes:
1. **Streaming Types** (`excel-addin/src/types/streaming.ts`) - Type definitions for streaming
2. **SignalR Client** - Added `streamChat` and `cancelStream` methods
3. **Message Handlers** - Added streaming support with `sendStreamingMessage` and `cancelCurrentStream`
4. **Chat Manager** - Added methods for updating streaming messages
5. **UI Components**:
   - `StreamingMessage.tsx` - Component for rendering streaming messages
   - `ToolIndicator.tsx` - Component for showing tool usage in real-time
6. **Chat Interface** - Updated to handle streaming messages and show cancel button

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

### 2. Start the Excel Add-in
```bash
cd excel-addin
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Basic Text Streaming
1. Open Excel with the add-in
2. Type: "Hello, how are you?"
3. **Expected**: Response appears word-by-word with a blinking cursor indicator

#### Tool Usage Streaming
1. Type: "Read the data in A1:A10"
2. **Expected**: 
   - Text streams in: "I'll read the data from cells A1:A10..."
   - Tool indicator appears: "ðŸ”„ Reading spreadsheet data..."
   - Tool completes: "âœ… Reading spreadsheet data (0.5s)"

#### Cancel Streaming
1. Type: "Explain financial modeling in detail"
2. While response is streaming, click the red Stop button
3. **Expected**: Streaming stops immediately

#### Multiple Tools
1. Type: "Calculate the sum of column B and write it to C1"
2. **Expected**: Multiple tool indicators appear sequentially

## What Gets Streamed

1. **AI Text Response** - Appears progressively as it's generated
2. **Tool Notifications** - Real-time visibility of tool usage:
   - Tool Start: "ðŸ”„ Reading spreadsheet data..."
   - Tool Progress: Updates during execution
   - Tool Complete: "âœ… Finished reading range"

## Important Notes

- Tool execution still follows the existing preview/accept flow
- Streaming is about response visibility, not changing the tool execution model
- The existing safety mechanisms remain intact

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Streaming endpoint is accessible at `/api/chat/stream`
- [ ] Frontend connects to streaming endpoint
- [ ] Text appears incrementally
- [ ] Tool indicators show during streaming
- [ ] Cancel button works
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Messages finalize correctly after streaming

## Troubleshooting

If streaming doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend is running and accessible
3. Check network tab for SSE connection
4. Ensure CORS headers are set correctly
5. Verify SignalR connection is authenticated
