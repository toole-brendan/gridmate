# Streaming Fix Complete Implementation

## Summary

The streaming implementation has been fully updated to support immediate tool execution during streaming, similar to Cursor, Cline, and roo-coder.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (Excel Add-in)

1. **Updated `useMessageHandlers.ts`**:
   - Added streaming mode detection in `handleToolRequest`
   - Tools execute immediately without preview when in streaming mode
   - Read operations bypass batching in streaming mode
   - Updated `sendFinalToolResponse` to include streaming mode flag in metadata
   - All tool response calls now pass the streaming mode flag

### Backend (Go Service)

1. **Updated `streaming.go`**:
   - Added streaming mode to context: `ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, "streaming_mode", true)`

2. **Updated `tool_executor.go`**:
   - Added streaming mode detection in `ExecuteTool`
   - Overrides autonomy mode to "full-autonomy" when in streaming mode
   - Logs when autonomy mode is overridden for streaming

3. **Updated `excel_bridge.go`**:
   - Added `processStreamingChunksWithTools` method
   - Intercepts tool chunks during streaming
   - Sends tool requests through SignalR instead of executing directly
   - Maintains streaming flow while tools execute on the client

4. **Updated `service.go`**:
   - Simplified `streamWithToolContinuation` to not wait for tool responses
   - Tools are now handled entirely through the SignalR bridge
   - Removed complex tool waiting logic

## How It Works

1. **User sends a message** that requires tool use
2. **Backend starts streaming** the AI response
3. **When a tool is needed**:
   - Backend sends tool chunks (tool_start, tool_progress, tool_complete)
   - Excel bridge intercepts these and sends a `tool_request` through SignalR
   - Frontend receives the request and detects streaming mode
   - Tool executes immediately without preview
   - Response is sent back with streaming_mode flag
4. **Stream continues** smoothly without stalling

## Key Features

- **No preview UI** during streaming mode
- **Immediate tool execution** for all tools
- **No batching** of read operations in streaming mode
- **Smooth, uninterrupted streaming** experience
- **Proper context propagation** throughout the stack

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Send a message like "Please create a DCF model in this sheet"
2. Observe that:
   - Text streams in real-time
   - Tools execute immediately without preview
   - No stalling or timeouts occur
   - The experience is smooth like Cursor/Cline

## Expected Behavior

- Streaming responses appear token-by-token
- Tool executions happen seamlessly during streaming
- No user intervention required for tool approval
- Backend doesn't wait for tool responses to continue streaming
- SignalR bridge handles all tool communication
