## Appendix: Code Examples

### Example 1: Chunked Message Rendering

```typescript
// services/streaming/ChunkedRenderer.ts
class ChunkedRenderer {
  private buffer: string[] = [];
  private updateTimer: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  
  addChunk(chunk: string) {
    this.buffer.push(chunk);
    if (!this.updateTimer) {
      this.updateTimer = setTimeout(() => this.flush(), 100);
    }
  }
  
  private flush() {
    const content = this.buffer.join('');
    this.onUpdate(content);
    this.buffer = [];
    this.updateTimer = null;
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Async Excel Operations

```typescript
// services/excel/AsyncExcelQueue.ts
class AsyncExcelQueue {
  async batchWrite(operations: WriteOperation[]) {
    await Excel.run(async (context) => {
      // Group operations by worksheet
      const grouped = this.groupByWorksheet(operations);
      
      // Execute in parallel per worksheet
      await Promise.all(
        Object.entries(grouped).map(([sheet, ops]) =>
          this.executeSheetOperations(context, sheet, ops)
        )
      );
      
      await context.sync();
    });
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Vector Store Query

```go
// services/memory/vector_store.go
func (vs *VectorStore) QueryWithCache(ctx context.Context, query string, limit int) ([]Chunk, error) {
    // Check cache first
    cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("query:%s:%d", query, limit)
    if cached, found := vs.cache.Get(cacheKey); found {
        return cached.([]Chunk), nil
    }
    
    // Perform vector search
    embedding := vs.embedder.Embed(query)
    results := vs.parallelSearch(embedding, limit)
    
    // Cache results
    vs.cache.Set(cacheKey, results, 5*time.Minute)
    return results, nil
}
```
