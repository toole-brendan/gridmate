## Summary of Changes

1. **Added WRITE_TOOLS constant** to properly identify write operations
2. **Refactored handleToolRequest** to queue write operations for visual diff instead of immediate execution
3. **Fixed handleAIResponse** to trigger diff preview when AI completes
4. **Fixed state accumulation bug** by clearing pendingDiffOps when starting new messages
5. **Added invoke method to SignalRClient** to support backend diff calculations

The visual diff orchestration is now properly implemented. Write operations in `agent-default` mode will be collected and previewed visually before execution.

## 1. Problem Diagnosis

The visual diff feature is not being triggered because the application's central message handling logic in `EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx` fails to route "write" operations to the visual diff system.

Based on the user-provided logs, we can see the following incorrect behavior:
1.  The AI suggests tool calls (e.g., `write_range`).
2.  The `handleToolRequest` function correctly identifies and auto-approves read-only tools (like `read_range`).
3.  However, when it receives a write tool, instead of initiating a visual preview, it adds the tool to a queue (`toolRequestQueue`).
4.  The tool is then sent to the backend with a `queued` status.
5.  Finally, a `Bulk approve` action is triggered, completely bypassing the intended visual diff workflow.

This is confirmed by the logs showing "Visual Diff Logs (0 entries)". The core issue is a logical flaw in how `handleToolRequest` and `executeToolRequest` interact within the `agent-default` autonomy mode.

## 2. Proposed Solution

The solution is to refactor the tool handling logic within `EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx` to correctly identify and group write operations, and then pass them to the `useDiffPreview` hook's `initiatePreview` function.

### **Primary File to Modify:**
- `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`

### **Key Changes:**

1.  **Introduce a `WRITE_TOOLS` constant:** Create a definitive list of tools that modify the grid and should trigger a visual diff. This avoids string-based checks like `tool.includes('write')`.
2.  **Refactor `handleToolRequest`:** This function will become the primary orchestrator. It will differentiate between read-only tools, write tools, and other tools.
3.  **Group Write Operations:** When in `agent-default` mode, instead of queuing write tools one-by-one, we will collect all consecutive write tool requests from a single AI response.
4.  **Trigger Preview:** Once the AI response is complete (indicated by an `ai_response` message), we will call `initiatePreview` with the entire group of collected write operations.
5.  **Deprecate Redundant Logic:** The flawed logic in `executeToolRequest` that attempts to call `initiatePreview` for single operations will be removed, as this responsibility will be moved to `handleToolRequest`.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Write Tools and State for Grouping

In `EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`, define the list of write tools and add a new state variable to hold pending write operations for the diff preview.

```typescript
// At the top of the file or in a constants file
const WRITE_TOOLS = new Set(['write_range', 'apply_formula', 'clear_range', 'smart_format_cells']);

// Inside the EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR component
export const EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR: React.FC = () => {
  // ... existing state
  const [pendingDiffOps, setPendingDiffOps] = useState<AISuggestedOperation[]>([]);
  // ...
```

### Step 2: Refactor `handleToolRequest`

Modify this function to handle the new logic for grouping write operations.

#### **Current Flawed Code (`handleToolRequest`)**
```typescript
  const handleToolRequest = useCallback(async (toolRequest: any) => {
    // ... (auto-approves read-only tools) ...
    
    if (autonomyMode === 'agent-default') {
      // <<< BUG: Immediately adds to UI and queues for later approval
      const suggestionMessage = createToolSuggestionMessage(toolRequest)
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, suggestionMessage])
      
      toolRequestQueue.current.set(toolRequest.request_id, toolRequest)
      
      await signalRClient.current?.send({
        type: 'tool_response',
        data: {
          request_id: toolRequest.request_id,
          result: { status: 'queued', message: 'Tool queued for user approval' },
          // ...
        }
      })
      return
    }
    // ... (handles YOLO mode) ...
  }, [/* ... dependencies ... */])
```

#### **Proposed New Code (`handleToolRequest`)**
```typescript
  const handleToolRequest = useCallback(async (toolRequest: any) => {
    console.log('🔧 Received tool request:', toolRequest)
    addToLog(`← Received tool_request: ${toolRequest.tool} (${toolRequest.request_id})`)
    
    // Auto-approve read-only tools immediately
    if (isReadOnlyTool(toolRequest.tool)) {
      addDebugLog(`Auto-approving read-only tool: ${toolRequest.tool}`, 'info')
      const suggestionMessage = createToolSuggestionMessage(toolRequest)
      suggestionMessage.status = 'approved'
      suggestionMessage.description = (suggestionMessage.description || '') + ' (Auto-approved)'
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, suggestionMessage])
      await executeToolRequest(toolRequest) // Execute immediately
      return
    }
    
    // In 'ask' mode, reject any non-read-only tool
    if (autonomyMode === 'ask') {
      await rejectToolRequest(toolRequest, 'Tool execution not allowed in Ask mode')
      return
    }
    
    // In 'agent-yolo' mode, execute immediately
    if (autonomyMode === 'agent-yolo') {
        const suggestionMessage = createToolSuggestionMessage(toolRequest)
        suggestionMessage.status = 'approved'
        setMessages(prev => [...prev, suggestionMessage])
        await executeToolRequest(toolRequest)
        return
    }

    // --- NEW LOGIC for 'agent-default' ---
    if (autonomyMode === 'agent-default') {
      // If it's a write tool, add it to the pending diff operations group
      if (WRITE_TOOLS.has(toolRequest.tool)) {
        addDebugLog(`Queueing write tool for diff preview: ${toolRequest.tool}`, 'info');
        const operation: AISuggestedOperation = {
          tool: toolRequest.tool,
          input: { ...toolRequest },
          description: getToolDescription(toolRequest.tool)
        };
        // Use a functional update to ensure we have the latest state
        setPendingDiffOps(prevOps => [...prevOps, operation]);

        // Still add a "pending" message to the UI for user visibility
        const suggestionMessage = createToolSuggestionMessage(toolRequest);
        setMessages(prev => [...prev, suggestionMessage]);

        // Inform the backend that the tool is queued, so it can continue generation
        await signalRClient.current?.send({
            type: 'tool_response',
            data: {
                request_id: toolRequest.request_id,
                result: { status: 'queued_for_preview', message: 'Tool queued for visual diff preview' },
                error: null,
                queued: true
            }
        });

      } else {
        // Handle non-write, non-read-only tools if any exist in the future
        // For now, treat them as standard suggestions
        const suggestionMessage = createToolSuggestionMessage(toolRequest);
        setMessages(prev => [...prev, suggestionMessage]);
      }
    }
  }, [autonomyMode, addDebugLog, addToLog, setMessages, signalRClient, isReadOnlyTool, setPendingDiffOps])
```

### Step 3: Trigger the Preview When AI Finishes

Modify `handleAIResponse` to check for and initiate the preview with the collected operations.

#### **Proposed New Code (`handleAIResponse`)**
```typescript
  const handleAIResponse = (response: any) => {
    console.log('🤖 Handling AI response:', response)
    
    // ... (remove thinking/generating messages) ...
    
    const aiMessage: ChatMessage = { /* ... */ }
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, aiMessage])
    setIsLoading(false)
    setAiIsGenerating(false)
    
    // --- NEW LOGIC ---
    // Check if there are pending diff operations to preview
    if (pendingDiffOps.length > 0) {
      addDebugLog(`AI response finished. Initiating diff preview for ${pendingDiffOps.length} operations.`, 'info');
      initiatePreview(pendingDiffOps);
      // Clear the pending operations now that they've been passed to the hook
      setPendingDiffOps([]);
    }
    // ...
  }
```

### Step 4: Simplify `executeToolRequest`

This function no longer needs to decide whether to trigger a diff. Its only job is to execute a tool call.

#### **Current Flawed Code (`executeToolRequest`)**
```typescript
  const executeToolRequest = useCallback(async (toolRequest: any) => {
    const { tool, request_id, ...input } = toolRequest
    
    // <<< BUG: This logic is in the wrong place and only handles one operation at a time.
    const shouldUseDiffPreview = tool.includes('write') || tool.includes('apply') || tool.includes('format')
    if (shouldUseDiffPreview && autonomyMode === 'agent-default') {
      // ... calls initiatePreview for a single operation ...
      return
    }
    
    // ... (rest of the execution logic) ...
  }, [/* ... */])
```

#### **Proposed New Code (`executeToolRequest`)**
```typescript
  const executeToolRequest = useCallback(async (toolRequest: any) => {
    const { tool, request_id, ...input } = toolRequest
    
    console.log('🎯 Executing tool request:', { tool, request_id })
    
    // The decision to use diff preview is now handled upstream.
    // This function's role is to execute the tool directly.
    
    setMessages(prev => prev.map(msg => 
      msg.id === `tool_${request_id}` && isToolSuggestion(msg)
        ? { ...msg, status: 'approved' } as ToolSuggestionMessage
        : msg
    ))
    
    const statusId = addStatusMessage({ /* ... */ })
    
    try {
      // ... (existing execution logic remains the same) ...
      const excelService = ExcelService.getInstance()
      const result = await excelService.executeToolRequest(tool, input)
      // ... (handle success, send response) ...
    } catch (error) {
      // ... (handle error, send response) ...
    }
    
    toolRequestQueue.current.delete(request_id)
  }, [/* ... dependencies ... */])
```

## 4. Verification Plan

After implementing the changes, perform the following tests:

1.  **Single Write Operation:**
    -   **Action:** In `agent-default` mode, ask the AI to "write 'Test' in cell A1".
    -   **Expected Result:**
        -   A "pending" tool suggestion for `write_range` appears in the chat.
        -   The "Visual Diff Logs" in the debug UI show `[🚀 Diff Start]`.
        -   The `DiffPreviewBar` appears.
        -   Cell A1 is highlighted in the grid.
        -   Clicking "Apply" writes the value to the cell and clears the highlights.

2.  **Multiple Write Operations:**
    -   **Action:** In `agent-default` mode, ask the AI to "in A1, write 'Revenue', and in A2, write 'COGS'".
    -   **Expected Result:**
        -   Two "pending" tool suggestions appear.
        -   The `initiatePreview` function is called **once** with an array of two operations.
        -   The `DiffPreviewBar` appears, summarizing both changes.
        -   Cells A1 and A2 are both highlighted.
        -   Clicking "Apply" executes both `write_range` calls.

3.  **Mixed Read/Write Operations:**
    -   **Action:** In `agent-default` mode, ask a question that requires reading first, then writing (e.g., "What is in A1? Then, write 'Updated' in B1").
    -   **Expected Result:**
        -   The `read_range` tool is auto-approved and executed immediately.
        -   The `write_range` tool is queued for the diff preview.
        -   The visual diff is triggered correctly for the `write_range` operation after the AI's final response.

4.  **YOLO Mode Test:**
    -   **Action:** Switch to `agent-yolo` mode and ask to "write 'YOLO' in C1".
    -   **Expected Result:** The `write_range`

## Final Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1 Completed Successfully!

The visual diff orchestration has been fixed and is now working with the following implementation:

1. **Write operations are correctly identified and queued** - The system now properly distinguishes between write operations (`write_range`, `apply_formula`, `clear_range`, `smart_format_cells`, `format_range`) and other operations.

2. **Operations are collected during AI response** - All write operations from a single AI response are collected in `pendingDiffOps`.

3. **Diff preview is triggered when AI completes** - The `handleAIResponse` function initiates the diff preview with all collected operations.

4. **Visual diff logs are working** - The logging system now properly displays all diff-related activities in the UI debug container.

5. **Client-side diff calculation implemented** - Since the backend doesn't yet have a SignalR `GetVisualDiff` method, we implemented client-side diff calculation that:
   - Creates before/after snapshots
   - Computes differences (added, deleted, modified cells)
   - Identifies formula vs value changes
   - Generates proper DiffHunk objects for visualization

### Known Limitations

1. **Backend integration pending** - The backend has a diff endpoint (`/api/diff/compute`) but not a SignalR method. Once the backend implements `GetVisualDiff` as a SignalR hub method, the client-side calculation can be replaced.

2. **Visual highlights not yet visible** - While the diff calculation is working, the actual visual highlights in Excel cells depend on the `GridVisualizer` implementation and the `DiffPreviewBar` component.

### Next Steps

To complete the visual diff feature:
1. Implement `GetVisualDiff` method in the backend SignalR hub
2. Ensure `GridVisualizer.applyHighlights()` is working correctly
3. Verify the `DiffPreviewBar` component displays and allows apply/cancel actions
4. Test with various types of operations (formulas, values, formatting)

The foundation is now solid and the orchestration logic is fully functional.
