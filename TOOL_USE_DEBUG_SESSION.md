# Gridmate Tool Use Implementation - Debug Session Summary

## Date: July 13, 2025

## Objective
Enable Claude/AI to directly manipulate Excel spreadsheets through tool use, implementing a Cursor-style two-stage pipeline where Claude acts as the reasoning layer and Excel tools act as the apply layer.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Re-enabled Tool Calling Infrastructure
- **File**: `backend/internal/services/ai/service.go`
  - Uncommented tool addition in `ProcessChatMessage` (lines 100-102)
  - Tool definitions are now sent with AI requests

### 2. Switched to Multi-Turn Tool Processing
- **File**: `backend/internal/services/excel_bridge.go`
  - Changed from `ProcessChatMessage` to `ProcessChatWithTools` (line 136)
  - Added logic to skip `detectRequestedActions` when tools were used (lines 144-149)
  - Added client ID storage in sessions for proper routing (line 249)

### 3. Fixed Critical Tool Executor Bug
- **Issue**: Two AI service instances were being created
  - One in `NewExcelBridge` with tool executor
  - Another in `main.go` that overwrote the first without tool executor
- **Fix**: `backend/cmd/api/main.go` (lines 89-95)
  - Transfer tool executor from bridge to main AI service
  - Added `GetToolExecutor` method to ExcelBridge

### 4. Fixed WebSocket Routing
- **File**: `backend/internal/websocket/client.go`
  - Changed tool response routing to use client ID instead of user ID (line 522)
- **File**: `backend/internal/websocket/hub.go`
  - Updated `SendToSession` to use client ID routing (line 318)

### 5. Fixed JSON Schema Validation Error
- **File**: `backend/internal/services/ai/tools.go`
  - Changed invalid `"type": "any"` to proper `oneOf` array (lines 53-58)
  - Now supports string, number, boolean, and null types

### 6. Fixed Anthropic API Error Format
- **File**: `backend/internal/services/ai/anthropic.go`
  - Convert tool result content to string format (lines 308-334)
  - Anthropic requires tool_result content to be string or content blocks

### 7. Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout:
  - Tool executor execution
  - WebSocket message routing
  - AI request/response flow
  - Error details from Anthropic API

## Current Status

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Tool definitions are properly sent to Claude
- Claude successfully attempts to use tools (e.g., `read_range`)
- Tool executor is properly initialized and connected
- WebSocket connections are established
- Frontend has tool request handlers implemented

### What's Not Working ‚ùå
- **Tool requests timeout after 30 seconds**
- Frontend never receives or responds to tool requests
- No errors in backend, but no response from frontend

## Current Issue Analysis

### The Problem
When Claude calls a tool:
1. ‚úÖ Claude correctly calls `read_range` tool
2. ‚úÖ Backend logs "Executing Excel tool"
3. ‚úÖ Backend logs "Sending tool request via WebSocket"
4. ‚ùå **30-second timeout** - No response from frontend
5. ‚úÖ Error is properly formatted and sent back to Claude
6. ‚úÖ Claude tries again but same timeout occurs

### Suspected Root Causes

1. **Session ID Mismatch**
   - The session ID (`session_1752379557596`) might not match any connected client ID
   - WebSocket routing might be sending to non-existent client

2. **Excel Add-in Not Receiving Messages**
   - Even though WebSocket is connected, tool requests might not reach the handler
   - Could be a message type or format issue

3. **Excel Office.js API Not Initialized**
   - The frontend might not have access to Excel's API
   - Could be permissions or initialization issue

4. **WebSocket Client Registration Issue**
   - The client might be connected but not properly registered for the session

## What We Need to Check

1. **Browser Console (F12) in Excel Add-in**
   - Look for "üîß Tool request received:" log
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify Office.js is loaded

2. **Backend Logs with Enhanced Debugging**
   - Check which client IDs are connected
   - Verify session ID matches a connected client
   - Look for any WebSocket send errors

3. **Frontend WebSocket Client**
   - Verify it's listening for 'tool_request' messages
   - Check if messages are arriving but not being processed

## Next Steps

1. **Debug WebSocket Routing**
   - Add more logging to see exact client/session ID mapping
   - Verify messages are being sent to correct client

2. **Test Frontend Directly**
   - Try sending a mock tool request to frontend
   - Verify Excel API access

3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
   - Use client ID directly instead of session ID
   - Implement broadcast to all clients as fallback

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
1. `backend/internal/services/ai/service.go` - Enabled tools, added logging
2. `backend/internal/services/excel_bridge.go` - Multi-turn processing, session handling
3. `backend/cmd/api/main.go` - Fixed tool executor transfer
4. `backend/internal/websocket/client.go` - Fixed response routing
5. `backend/internal/websocket/hub.go` - Updated session routing
6. `backend/internal/services/ai/tools.go` - Fixed JSON schema
7. `backend/internal/services/ai/anthropic.go` - Fixed tool result format
8. `backend/internal/services/ai/tool_executor.go` - Added logging
9. `backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go` - Added request logging

### Key Configuration Changes
- Increased MaxTokens from 4096 to 8192 for complex tool sequences
- Enhanced system prompt to encourage tool use
- Added debug logging throughout the stack

## Test Case
**Query**: "What are the values in cells A1 to A3?"
**Expected**: Claude uses `read_range` tool to read Excel data
**Actual**: Tool request times out, no response from frontend
