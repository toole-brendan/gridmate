# Streaming Fixes Applied

## Summary
Applied comprehensive fixes to restore streaming functionality in GridMate. The streaming was failing due to state management issues between messages and blocking preview cards. This update includes both critical fixes and reliability improvements.

## Fixes Applied

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Completed)

### 1. Added handleUserMessageSent Call
**File**: `excel-addin/src/components/chat/RefactoredChatInterface.tsx`
- Added missing call to `handleUserMessageSent` when sending a new message
- This ensures proper state reset between messages, clearing:
  - Pending preview cards
  - Operation queues and counters
  - Processed request tracking
  - Message timeouts

### 2. Fixed Diff Preview Message ID Handling
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useChatManager.ts`
- Modified `addMessage` to preserve IDs for special message types ('diff-preview', 'tool-suggestion', 'batch-operation')
- Previously, all messages were getting new UUIDs regardless of provided ID
- This fix allows `handlePreviewAccept/Reject` to find and update preview messages correctly

### 3. Implemented Auto-Accept for Old Previews
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Added logic to auto-accept pending previews when new tool requests arrive
- Prevents the system from getting stuck waiting for user action on old previews
- Ensures only one preview is active at a time as designed

### 4. Added Streaming Message Verification
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Added check to verify streaming message exists before attempting updates
- Logs current messages if streaming message is not found for debugging
- Prevents potential errors from trying to update non-existent messages

### Phase 2: Reliability Improvements (Completed)

### 5. Enhanced StreamingMessage Component with Local State
**File**: `excel-addin/src/components/chat/messages/StreamingMessage.tsx`
- Added local state management to ensure UI updates during streaming
- Prevents React rendering issues from rapid state changes
- Ensures content is displayed even if parent re-renders

### 6. Added Retry Logic for State Updates
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Implemented retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts) for chunk updates
- Handles transient state update failures gracefully
- Logs warnings and errors for debugging

### 7. Implemented Streaming Health Checks
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Added periodic health check every 2 seconds during streaming
- Detects stalled streams (no updates for 10+ seconds)
- Automatically cleans up and finalizes stalled streams
- Proper cleanup of health check intervals on completion/error

### 8. Added Error Boundary
**Files**: 
- `excel-addin/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new)
- `excel-addin/src/components/chat/RefactoredChatInterface.tsx`
- Created comprehensive error boundary component
- Wrapped chat interface to catch and handle rendering errors
- Provides fallback UI and recovery mechanism
- Logs errors for debugging

### 9. Added Clear All Previews Function
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- New `clearAllPreviews` function to manually clear stuck previews
- Auto-rejects all pending previews
- Resets all operation tracking state
- Useful for recovery from stuck states

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Streaming Test**:
   - Send a simple question that doesn't involve tools
   - Verify text appears character by character with blinking cursor

2. **Tool Streaming Test**:
   - Ask to "create a DCF model" or similar tool-triggering request
   - Verify:
     - Initial text streams until tool suggestion
     - Tool indicator appears with spinning icon
     - Diff preview card shows up
     - Text continues after tool completion

3. **Multiple Message Test**:
   - Send a message that creates a diff preview
   - Without accepting/rejecting, send another message
   - Verify the old preview is auto-accepted and new message streams properly

4. **Preview Resolution Test**:
   - Create a diff preview
   - Accept or reject it
   - Verify the preview card is removed and no lingering state

## Additional Testing

### Health Check Testing
1. Start a long streaming response
2. Simulate network delay/pause
3. Verify health check detects stall and cleans up after 10 seconds

### Error Recovery Testing
1. Trigger a rendering error (if possible)
2. Verify error boundary catches it
3. Click "Try Again" to recover

### Manual Preview Clearing
1. Create multiple diff previews without accepting
2. Call `messageHandlers.clearAllPreviews()` from console
3. Verify all previews are cleared

## Remaining Improvements (Optional)

From the original plan, these enhancements could still be added:
1. **Performance Optimizations**: Chunk batching, virtual scrolling
2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Progress indicators, speed controls
3. **Advanced Error Handling**: Network retry logic, offline support
4. **Monitoring**: Streaming metrics, performance tracking

## Success Indicators

- Streaming text appears immediately (within 500ms)
- No blank/frozen UI during streaming
- Preview cards don't block subsequent messages
- Clean state between messages (no carryover)
