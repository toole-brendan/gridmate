# Cursor-Style Implementation Plan for Gridmate

## Executive Summary
This plan addresses the critical issues discovered during DCF model creation, implementing solutions inspired by how Cursor handles code editing with AI assistance. The goal is to make Gridmate's financial modeling as seamless and intelligent as Cursor's code editing.

## Core Issues Identified

1. **Dimension Mismatch Error**: Writing single values to multi-cell ranges fails
2. **Out-of-Order Approval**: Operations fail when approved in wrong order
3. **Stale Context**: AI continues to think spreadsheet is empty after writes
4. **Poor Error Reporting**: Errors lack actionable details
5. **No Operation Dependencies**: System doesn't understand operation relationships
6. **Missing Batch Operations**: Each operation requires individual approval

## Cursor-Inspired Solutions

### 1. Intelligent Value Expansion (Like Cursor's Multi-Cursor)
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

When writing a single value to a range, automatically expand it to fill the entire range, similar to how Cursor handles multi-cursor editing.

```go
// Example: Writing "DCF Model" to A1:M1
// Before: Error - dimension mismatch
// After: Automatically fills all 13 cells with "DCF Model"
```

### 2. Smart Operation Queue with Dependencies
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Created `QueuedOperationRegistry` with:
- Dependency tracking between operations
- Automatic cancellation of dependent ops when prerequisites fail
- Priority-based execution ordering
- Batch operation support

### 3. Context-Aware System Prompts
**Status**: 🚧 To Implement

Update the AI system prompt dynamically after each operation, similar to how Cursor maintains awareness of code changes.

#### Implementation Steps:

**File**: `backend/internal/services/ai/service.go`

```go
// Add to ProcessChatWithToolsAndHistory
func (s *AIService) RefreshContext(ctx context.Context, sessionID string) (string, error) {
    // 1. Get current spreadsheet state
    rangeData, err := s.excelBridge.ReadRange(ctx, sessionID, "A1:Z100", true, false)
    
    // 2. Get pending operations
    pendingOps := s.queuedOpsRegistry.GetPendingOperations(sessionID)
    
    // 3. Build enhanced context
    context := fmt.Sprintf(`Current Context:
Workbook: %s
Worksheet: %s
Last Modified: %s

Current Data Summary:
%s

Pending Operations (%d):
%s

Instructions:
- Operations marked as "queued" are awaiting user approval
- Do not retry queued operations
- Consider pending operations when planning next steps
`, workbook, worksheet, time.Now(), dataSummary, len(pendingOps), pendingOpsSummary)
    
    return context, nil
}
```

### 4. Predictive Operation Batching
**Status**: 🚧 To Implement

Detect related operations and batch them for single approval, like Cursor's intelligent code completion.

#### Implementation:

```go
// Detect patterns like:
// - Multiple writes to same row/column
// - Formula + formatting for same range
// - Sequential operations on adjacent cells

func (te *ToolExecutor) DetectBatchableOperations(ops []ToolCall) [][]ToolCall {
    batches := [][]ToolCall{}
    
    // Group by operation type and proximity
    for i, op := range ops {
        if isBatchable(op, ops[i+1:]) {
            // Add to batch
        }
    }
    
    return batches
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Messages with Context
**Status**: 🚧 To Implement

Provide Cursor-style helpful error messages with suggestions.

**File**: `backend/internal/services/ai/tool_executor.go`

```go
type EnhancedError struct {
    Error       string
    Context     string
    Suggestion  string
    RelatedOps  []string
}

// Example:
return EnhancedError{
    Error: "Dimension mismatch: provided 1x1, expected 1x13",
    Context: "Trying to write header to merged cells A1:M1",
    Suggestion: "The header will be automatically expanded to fill all cells",
    RelatedOps: []string{"Previous write to A1", "Upcoming format operation"},
}
```

### 6. Undo/Redo Functionality
**Status**: ✅ Partially Implemented

Support Cursor-style undo/redo for all operations.

```go
// Already implemented in QueuedOperationRegistry:
- UndoLastOperation()
- RedoLastOperation()

// Need to add:
- UI integration
- Inverse operation generation
- State snapshot management
```

### 7. Smart Approval UI Updates
**Status**: 🚧 To Implement

Update the Excel add-in to show:
- Operation dependencies visually
- Batch operations grouped together
- "Approve All in Order" button
- Preview of what each operation will do

**File**: `excel-addin/src/components/chat/PendingActionsPanel.tsx`

```tsx
interface EnhancedPendingAction {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  description: string;
  preview: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  batchId?: string;
  canApproveNow: boolean;
}

// Visual indicators:
// ✅ Can approve now
// ⏸️ Waiting for dependencies
// 🔗 Part of batch
// ⚠️ Will affect other operations
```

3. **Context Accuracy**: AI correctly references current spreadsheet state
4. **Batch Efficiency**: 50% reduction in approval clicks through batching
5. **Error Clarity**: 90% of errors include actionable suggestions

## Technical Architecture Changes

### 1. Enhanced Tool Result Structure
```go
type ToolResult struct {
    Content     interface{}
    IsError     bool
    Status      string // "success", "queued", "error"
    Details     map[string]interface{}
    Preview     string // What changed
    Context     string // Why it was done
}
```

### 2. Operation Dependency Graph
```go
type OperationGraph struct {
    Nodes map[string]*Operation
    Edges map[string][]string // Dependencies
    
    TopologicalSort() []string
    CanExecute(opID string) bool
    GetBatchCandidates() [][]string
}
```

### 3. Context State Manager
```go
type ContextStateManager struct {
    CurrentState   *SpreadsheetState
    PendingChanges map[string]*Change
    History        []StateSnapshot
    
    ApplyChange(change *Change) *SpreadsheetState
    GetProjectedState() *SpreadsheetState
    Rollback(toSnapshot string) error
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain compatibility with existing frontend
2. **Performance**: Batch operations reduce API calls and improve speed
3. **Data Integrity**: All operations are reversible through undo
4. **User Trust**: Preview shows exactly what will happen before approval

## Conclusion

By implementing these Cursor-inspired features, Gridmate will provide the same level of intelligent assistance for financial modeling that Cursor provides for code editing. The key is making the AI context-aware, predictive, and resilient to user actions while maintaining the precision required for financial modeling.
