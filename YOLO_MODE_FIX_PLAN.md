# Implementation Plan: YOLO Mode Fix

## 1. Ultimate Goal

The primary goal is to fix "YOLO Mode" to align with its intended behavior: automatically executing virtually all tool requests from the AI without requiring user approval. This will make it distinct from the "Default Mode" and provide a truly autonomous experience for the user.

---

## 2. The Problem

The investigation revealed that YOLO mode currently feels identical to Default mode because of a safety check that overrides its autonomous behavior.

*   **File:** `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`
*   **Function:** `executeToolRequest`
*   **Root Cause:** Inside this function, a call to `checkToolSafety()` flags certain operations as "high risk." An `if` statement then explicitly checks `if (autonomyMode === 'agent-yolo' && safetyCheck.riskLevel === 'high')` and forces these high-risk tools into the manual approval queue, defeating the purpose of YOLO mode.

---

## 3. Implementation Plan

The fix involves removing this overly cautious safety check for YOLO mode.

### Step 3.1: Modify the Tool Execution Logic

*   **File to Edit:** `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`
*   **Objective:** Remove the "high risk" check that forces YOLO mode into a manual approval flow.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Navigate to the `executeToolRequest` function.
    2.  Locate and **delete** the entire `if (autonomyMode === 'agent-yolo' && ...)` block. The code to be removed is:
        ```typescript
        // In YOLO mode, check if operation is high risk
        if (autonomyMode === 'agent-yolo' && safetyCheck.riskLevel === 'high') {
          console.warn('⚠️ High-risk operation detected in YOLO mode:', safetyCheck.reason)
          
          // Still queue for approval even in YOLO mode for high-risk operations
          const pendingAction: PendingAction = {
            id: request_id,
            toolName: tool,
            parameters: toolRequest,
            description: `⚠️ HIGH RISK: ${getToolDescription(tool)} - ${safetyCheck.reason}`,
            timestamp: new Date()
          }
          
          toolRequestQueue.current.set(request_id, toolRequest)
          setPendingActions(prev => [...prev, pendingAction])
          addToLog(`⚠️ High-risk operation queued for approval: ${request_id}`)
          return
        }
        ```
    3.  The `const safetyCheck = checkToolSafety(tool, input)` line can also be removed as it will no longer be used in this function.

### Step 3.2: Verify System Behavior

*   After applying the change, the system should be tested to confirm the following:
    1.  When in **YOLO mode**, tool requests (such as writing data, applying formulas, etc.) are executed immediately without appearing in the pending actions queue.
    2.  When in **Default mode**, the same tool requests are still correctly queued for user approval.
    3.  When in **Ask mode**, tools that make changes are still correctly blocked.

This change is surgical and directly addresses the identified issue. It will restore YOLO mode to its intended, fully autonomous state.
