# Streaming Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### streaming.go
- Added detailed logging with chunk counters and timing
- Each chunk now logs: chunk number, type, delta presence, and elapsed time
- Added import for `time` package
- Completion logs show total chunks and duration

#### azure_openai.go
- Fixed chunk structure to include proper `type` and `delta` fields
- Set `Done` flag correctly
- Maintains `Content` field for compatibility

#### excel_bridge.go  
- Reduced channel buffer size from default to 1 for better streaming
- Properly accumulates content using `chunk.Content` instead of `chunk.Delta`
- Fixed chat history saving with proper message structure

### 2. SignalR Service Changes

#### GridmateHub.cs
- Added chunk counter and timing logging
- Added 10ms delay between chunks to prevent batching
- Logs each chunk with size and timing information
- Added `TestStream` method for debugging

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### useMessageHandlers.ts
- Added detailed chunk reception logging
- Tracks chunk count and timing
- Logs chunk type and delta presence
- Reports total chunks and duration on completion

#### SignalRClient.ts
- Added `testStreaming()` method for debugging

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

#### New Test Endpoint
- Added `/api/test/stream` endpoint that sends known chunks with 200ms delays
- Each chunk contains one word from a test message
- Helps verify the streaming pipeline works correctly

## How to Test

### 1. Enable Debug Logging
```bash
# Backend
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Or in your .env file
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

### 2. Run All Services
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
go run cmd/api/main.go

# Terminal 2 - SignalR
cd signalr-service/GridmateSignalR
dotnet run --launch-profile https

# Terminal 3 - Frontend
cd excel-addin
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Streaming Pipeline

#### Option A: Test Endpoint
In the browser console after the app loads:
```javascript
// Get the SignalR client instance
const client = window.signalRClient; // or however you access it
await client.testStreaming();
```

Watch for:
- Multiple "[Stream] Chunk #X received" logs over time
- Each chunk should arrive separately with ~200ms between them
- Should see ~20 chunks total

#### Option B: Regular Chat
Send a message that requires a longer response:
```
"Please make DCF model in this sheet, use mock data"
```

### 4. What to Look For

#### Backend Logs
```
[DEBUG] Sending chunk {"chunk_number": 1, "chunk_type": "text", "has_delta": true, "is_done": false, "elapsed_ms": 100}
[DEBUG] Sending chunk {"chunk_number": 2, "chunk_type": "text", "has_delta": true, "is_done": false, "elapsed_ms": 300}
...
[INFO] Streaming completed successfully {"total_chunks": 15, "duration_ms": 3500}
```

#### SignalR Logs
```
[HUB] Forwarding chunk #1 at 100ms: 45 chars
[HUB] Forwarding chunk #2 at 350ms: 52 chars
...
[HUB] Streaming completed for session X. Total chunks: 15, Duration: 3500ms
```

#### Browser Console
```
[Stream] Chunk #1 received at 150ms, length: 45
[Stream] Chunk type: text, has delta: true
[Stream] Chunk #2 received at 400ms, length: 52
...
[Stream] Completed. Total chunks: 15, Duration: 3600ms
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Only One Chunk Appears:
1. Check if AI_PROVIDER is set correctly (anthropic or azure)
2. Verify the AI provider API key is valid
3. Check for HTTP/2 or proxy buffering issues

### If No Chunks Appear:
1. Check CORS settings
2. Verify SignalR connection is established
3. Check for WebSocket connection issues

### If Chunks Arrive All at Once:
1. The AI provider might not support streaming
2. There might be a proxy or CDN buffering responses
3. Try the test endpoint to isolate the issue

## Next Steps

If the test endpoint works (chunks arrive separately) but real AI responses don't:
1. The issue is with the AI provider configuration
2. Try switching AI providers: `export AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` or `export AI_PROVIDER=azure`

If the test endpoint also sends everything at once:
1. There's a infrastructure issue (proxy, CDN, etc.)
2. Check for buffering in any reverse proxies
3. Ensure HTTP/1.1 is being used (some HTTP/2 implementations buffer SSE)
