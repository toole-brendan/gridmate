# Conversation Summary - January 15, 2025

## Overview
This conversation focused on fixing API errors, implementing UI improvements for context-aware features, and enhancing the chat interface based on the CONTEXT_CHIP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Anthropic API 529 Overload Error
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/internal/services/ai/anthropic.go`

**Changes:**
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for retry logic
- Added support for 529 status code (overloaded) as retryable
- Enhanced retry mechanism to respect `Retry-After` header from API responses
- Added random seed initialization for proper jitter calculation

### 2. Fixed Bulk Action Buttons ("Accept All" / "Reject All")
**Files Modified:**
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Made buttons permanently visible (removed conditional rendering)
- Fixed pending tools count to include ALL pending tools, not just from current response
- Updated bulk action handler to process all pending tools regardless of response ID
- Buttons now properly enable/disable based on pending tool count

### 3. Implemented Context Chip Implementation Plan
**Files Created:**
- `/excel-addin/src/components/common/ContextChip.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterfaceWithSignalR.tsx`
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedAutonomySelector.tsx`
- `/excel-addin/src/components/chat/mentions/MentionableTextarea.tsx`
- `/backend/internal/services/ai/prompt_builder.go`

**Changes:**

#### Step 2.1: Real-time Context Updates
- Replaced 30-second interval with event-based selection monitoring
- Added `Office.EventType.DocumentSelectionChanged` listener
- Implemented fallback to Excel-specific event handling

#### Step 2.2: Created ContextChip Component
- Built reusable component for displaying context information
- Added support for click handling and disabled state
- Gracefully handles empty values

#### Step 2.3: Updated Chat UI
- Made welcome screen suggestions clickable buttons
- Integrated context chips showing live Excel selection
- Fixed data access issues (selectedRange as string, not object)

#### Step 2.4: Fixed Dropdown Positioning
- Fixed autonomy selector to always open upward
- Fixed mention dropdown (@) to appear above textarea input

#### Step 3.1: Enhanced Backend Prompt Builder
- Modified to always include selection context when available
- Changed format from `<current_context>` to `<context>` tags
- Removed requirement for cell values to include selection

### 4. Additional Context Chip Improvements
**Changes:**
- Removed redundant context chip from welcome screen
- Changed chip label from "Selection" to "Context"
- Made chip clickable to toggle context inclusion in AI prompts
- Added visual feedback for enabled/disabled state
- Context still updates in real-time but only sent to AI when enabled

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Resilient API handling** with exponential backoff and jitter
2. **Always-visible bulk action buttons** for tool approval/rejection
3. **Real-time context awareness** with Excel selection tracking
4. **Clickable context chip** for user control over context inclusion
5. **Improved dropdown positioning** for better UX
6. **Interactive welcome suggestions** for easier onboarding

## Technical Notes
- Used event-based architecture for Excel selection changes instead of polling
- Implemented proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing features
- Followed TypeScript best practices and proper component composition
