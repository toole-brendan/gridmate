Thanks for confirming. I’ll now prepare a detailed, file-by-file, line-by-line implementation plan based on the latest version of the Gridmate repo. The goal is to fully implement dynamic context gathering (mirroring Cline/Cursor) with always-on context, Claude tool-use support for autonomous range reading, and backend integration.

I'll let you know as soon as the implementation guide is ready.


**1. Enable Always-On Context:** In the front-end, default context inclusion is already `true`. In **`excel-addin/src/components/chat/RefactoredChatInterface.tsx`**, confirm the state `isContextEnabled` is initialized to `true` (line 73). Next, remove the manual toggle UI so the user can’t disable context. In **`excel-addin/src/components/chat/EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`** at the Context Pills container (around lines 587–593), delete or comment out the `onContextToggle` button. For example:

```tsx
<ContextPillsContainer 
    items={activeContext}
    onRemove={onContextRemove}
    /* onContextToggle={onContextToggle} */  {/* REMOVE toggle handler */}
    isContextEnabled={true}  {/* Always enabled */}
    … 
/>
```

This ensures context is always on and removes the toggle UI “context pill” that previously enabled/disabled it.

**2. Use `getComprehensiveContext` for Full Sheet & Workbook Summary:** In **`RefactoredChatInterface.tsx`** inside `handleSendMessage`, replace the call to `ExcelService.getSmartContext()` with `getComprehensiveContext({ includeAllSheets: true })`. For example, at line 220:

```ts
// OLD:
const excelContext = isContextEnabled ? await ExcelService.getInstance().getSmartContext() : null;

// NEW:
const excelContext = isContextEnabled 
    ? await ExcelService.getInstance().getComprehensiveContext({ includeAllSheets: true }) 
    : null;
```

This gathers the active sheet’s entire used range plus a summary of all sheets. After retrieving `excelContext`, override the selected range data to ensure the active sheet’s data is treated as the primary context:

```ts
if (excelContext?.visibleRangeData) {
    // Use full sheet as selected context
    excelContext.selectedData = excelContext.visibleRangeData;
    excelContext.selectedRange = excelContext.visibleRangeData.address;
}
```

Insert the above before building `messagePayload`. This way, even if the user had a smaller selection, we treat the whole used range of the active sheet as the context.

Now include the workbook summary and full-sheet data in the payload. Modify the `excelContext` object construction (around lines 253–261) to add `visibleRangeData` and `workbookSummary`:

```js
data: {
  messageId,
  content,
  excelContext: {
    workbook: excelContext?.workbook,
    worksheet: excelContext?.worksheet,
    selectedRange: excelContext?.selectedRange,
    selectedData: excelContext?.selectedData,
    visibleRangeData: excelContext?.visibleRangeData,     // ADD: full active sheet data
    workbookSummary: excelContext?.workbookSummary,       // ADD: workbook summary
    nearbyData: excelContext?.nearbyData, 
    activeContext: activeContext.map(c => ({ type: c.type, value: c.value }))
  },
  autonomyMode,
}
```

This ensures the back-end receives the active sheet’s full data (`visibleRangeData`) and a summary of all sheets (`workbookSummary`) on every request.

**3. Remove/Refactor Context Pill UI:** The context pill that displayed the current selection is no longer needed for context inclusion. In **`excel-addin/src/components/chat/mentions/ContextPill.tsx`** inside `ContextPillsContainer`, prevent the “NO RANGE SELECTED” placeholder from showing when nothing is selected. Remove or disable the placeholder logic at lines 125–133. For example:

```ts
if (isPlaceholder) {
   // **REMOVE** placeholder insertion so no pill is shown when no explicit selection
   displayItems = [];  
   // Keep pillsAreEnabled = true to avoid disabled styling
}
```

Also ensure the pill click does nothing (since context is always on). In the same `ContextPillsContainer` (around line 119), remove the special onClick for selection pills. For instance:

```ts
let pillClickHandler = (item: ContextItem) => undefined;  // No toggle on click
// (Remove the conditional assigning onContextToggle to selection-type pills)
```

With these changes, the context pill UI no longer acts as a toggle and will simply display context info when relevant. In fact, with always-on full-sheet context, you may choose to remove the context pill display entirely. If desired, delete the `<ContextPillsContainer>` element in **`EnhancedChatInterface.tsx`** (lines 587–593) to fully remove it from the UI.

**4. Fix Frontend→Backend Context Structure Mismatches:** Ensure the backend correctly parses the new context fields. In **`backend/internal/services/excel_bridge.go`** (`ExcelBridge.buildFinancialContext`), update the parsing of `selectedData` to look at the root context map (the SignalR payload) in addition to additionalContext. For example, at about line 817:

```go
// OLD:
if sd, ok := additionalContext["selectedData"].(map[string]interface{}); ok {
    selectedData = sd
    …
}
// NEW:
var selectedData map[string]interface{}
if sd, ok := context["selectedData"].(map[string]interface{}); ok {
    selectedData = sd
} else if sd, ok := additionalContext["selectedData"].(map[string]interface{}); ok {
    selectedData = sd
}
if selectedData != nil {
    … // process values and formulas
}
```

This change (first checking `context` – the root ExcelContext map – for `selectedData`) matches how the front-end now sends data. Similarly, ensure we use the new `nearbyData` key: in the same function, replace references to the deprecated `"nearbyRange"` with `"nearbyData"`. The code already does this (see line 849–857), logging a warning if it finds `nearbyRange`. Make sure the front-end is sending `nearbyData` (which we did in step 2).

Critically, we need to handle the workbook summary on the backend. Since the backend’s FinancialContext doesn’t directly store a full workbook structure, we will incorporate the summary as textual context. Still in `buildFinancialContext`, after processing nearbyData, parse the workbook summary if present:

```go
if wbSummary, ok := additionalContext["workbookSummary"].(map[string]interface{}); ok {
    if sheets, ok := wbSummary["sheets"].([]interface{}); ok {
        // Compose up to 3 summary lines to avoid too much content
        summaryLines := []string{}
        for i, sheet := range sheets {
            if i >= 3 { break } // limit to 3 sheets for token safety
            if sheetMap, ok := sheet.(map[string]interface{}); ok {
                // Gather sheet name and size
                name := sheetMap["name"].(string)
                rows := sheetMap["lastRow"].(int) 
                cols := sheetMap["lastColumn"].(int)
                // Check if full data was provided or truncated
                truncated := false
                if data, ok := sheetMap["data"].(map[string]interface{}); ok {
                    if vals, ok := data["values"].([]interface{}); ok && len(vals) == 1 && fmt.Sprint(vals[0]) == "[Sheet too large to load fully]" {
                        truncated = true
                    }
                }
                // Create summary text
                summary := fmt.Sprintf("%s: %d×%d cells%s", name, rows, cols, truncated ? " (partial)" : "")
                summaryLines = append(summaryLines, summary)
            }
        }
        if len(summaryLines) > 0 {
            context.DocumentContext = append(context.DocumentContext, summaryLines...)
        }
    }
}
```

This code (insert around line 848, after nearbyData processing) iterates over sheets and appends a brief summary (e.g. “Sheet1: 20×7 cells”) to the `DocumentContext`. We limit to 3 sheets to respect token limits. The prompt builder will include these lines as an external document context, so Claude sees an overview of the workbook structure without overflowing tokens.

**5. Support `read_range` Tool Calls (Claude 3/4 Integration):** The tool definitions already include `"read_range"` and the system prompt advertises it. We need to ensure the AI can actually use it to fetch data mid-conversation. On the backend, the iterative tool-use loop in **`backend/internal/services/ai/service.go`** (`ProcessChatWithToolsAndHistory`) already handles tool calls. Verify that when a tool call is returned, it gets executed and the result is fed back to Claude:

– In `ProcessChatWithToolsAndHistory`, after getting a response, if `response.ToolCalls` is non-empty, the code executes them and appends the results as a new user message before continuing. Ensure this logic is enabled. It should create an assistant message with the tool call (including `Name: "read_range"` and its parameters) and then call `ProcessToolCalls` to execute it, as shown at lines 861–867.

– Inside `ProcessToolCalls`, confirm that `ToolExecutor.ExecuteTool` is invoked for each tool (see line 481). The `ToolExecutor` is wired to our Excel bridge, so calling `ExecuteTool` with a `read_range` ToolCall will ultimately invoke `ExcelBridge.ReadRange`. No code change is needed here; just ensure `EnableActions` is true and tools are being added to the request (in `Service.ProcessChatMessage`, `EnableActions` is set and we call `selectRelevantTools` to include read\_range for read queries).

On the front-end, implement handling of the incoming tool request and its result via SignalR. The Excel bridge sends a SignalR “tool\_request” for read\_range which the add-in must fulfill. In **`excel-addin/src/services/signalr/SignalRClient.ts`**, find the handler for incoming tool requests (e.g. a case handling a `"toolRequest"` message). Use `ExcelService` to perform the requested action. For a `read_range` request, call `ExcelService.getInstance().getRange(rangeAddress)` or similar and return the values. For example:

```ts
signalRConnection.on("toolRequest", async (toolReq) => {
   if (toolReq.name === "read_range") {
      const { range, include_formulas, include_formatting } = toolReq.input;
      try {
         // Use Excel JS APIs to get the range values (and formulas if requested)
         const worksheet = ExcelService.getInstance();
         const data = await worksheet.readRange(range, include_formulas, include_formatting);
         // Send tool response back
         signalRClient.sendToolResponse(toolReq.request_id, { result: data });
      } catch (err) {
         signalRClient.sendToolResponse(toolReq.request_id, { error: String(err) });
      }
   }
   // ... handle other tools
});
```

Make sure the `ExcelService.readRange` method (if it exists) or a new helper returns a structured object compatible with our `RangeData` interface – i.e., `{ values: any[][], formulas?: any[][], address: string, rowCount: number, colCount: number }`. The backend will receive this as the tool result.

**6. Feed Tool Output Back into Conversation:** The backend already inserts tool results into the next model prompt. In `ProcessChatWithToolsAndHistory`, after executing tools we append a “user” role message with the `ToolResults` (see `toolResultMsg` at line 947). This means Claude sees the output of `read_range` as an observation before continuing. No additional front-end action is needed – the user won’t see a card (we explicitly filter out rendering of read\_range suggestions), but Claude’s next reply will incorporate the fetched data. For completeness, verify that `ToolSuggestionCard` does not show read\_range (it already returns `null` for `message.tool.name === 'read_range'`). This way, the tool is used transparently, and the conversation continues with the AI having the new context.

**7. Respect Token Limits – Summarize Large Data:** We maintain a 10,000-cell limit to avoid sending excessive data. The `getComprehensiveContext` call already uses `maxCellsPerSheet = 10000` by default. Sheets larger than this are not fully loaded; instead, the workbook summary notes their size and we set a placeholder (“Sheet too large to load fully”). This keeps the initial context concise.

For dynamic `read_range` tool calls, implement similar safeguards. In the front-end tool handler for `read_range`, detect if the requested range is huge. For example, after loading the range in `ExcelService.readRange`, if `rowCount * colCount` exceeds a threshold (e.g. 5000 cells), do not send every cell. Instead, you can send a truncated result or a summary. One approach is to send a single-cell marker with the shape of the range. For instance:

```ts
if (rowCount * colCount > 5000) {
   return {
     values: [[`<< ${rowCount}x${colCount} range too large to display >>`]],
     address: range.address,
     rowCount,
     colCount
   };
}
```

This ensures the AI is aware that the range is large without flooding it with data. (The AI can then decide to narrow the request or proceed accordingly.) The backend will pass this message through as the tool result. We already handle such placeholders in our workbook summary parsing. By chunking or summarizing large outputs and by limiting context to used ranges, we prevent token overflow while still providing useful information.

Overall, these changes make the AI assistant “context-aware” and self-guided. Every question will include the spreadsheet’s context by default (no user toggle needed), the AI can autonomously call `read_range` to fetch additional cells, and the results are looped back into the conversation for Claude to reason over. All modifications are done in the specific files and lines above to implement a context-rich, Cursor/Cline-style Excel assistant.
