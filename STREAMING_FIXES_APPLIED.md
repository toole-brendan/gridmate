# Streaming Fixes Applied

## Summary
Applied critical fixes to restore streaming functionality in GridMate. The streaming was failing due to state management issues between messages and blocking preview cards.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added handleUserMessageSent Call
**File**: `excel-addin/src/components/chat/RefactoredChatInterface.tsx`
- Added missing call to `handleUserMessageSent` when sending a new message
- This ensures proper state reset between messages, clearing:
  - Pending preview cards
  - Operation queues and counters
  - Processed request tracking
  - Message timeouts

### 2. Fixed Diff Preview Message ID Handling
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useChatManager.ts`
- Modified `addMessage` to preserve IDs for special message types ('diff-preview', 'tool-suggestion', 'batch-operation')
- Previously, all messages were getting new UUIDs regardless of provided ID
- This fix allows `handlePreviewAccept/Reject` to find and update preview messages correctly

### 3. Implemented Auto-Accept for Old Previews
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Added logic to auto-accept pending previews when new tool requests arrive
- Prevents the system from getting stuck waiting for user action on old previews
- Ensures only one preview is active at a time as designed

### 4. Added Streaming Message Verification
**File**: `excel-addin/src/hooks/useMessageHandlers.ts`
- Added check to verify streaming message exists before attempting updates
- Logs current messages if streaming message is not found for debugging
- Prevents potential errors from trying to update non-existent messages

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Streaming Test**:
   - Send a simple question that doesn't involve tools
   - Verify text appears character by character with blinking cursor

2. **Tool Streaming Test**:
   - Ask to "create a DCF model" or similar tool-triggering request
   - Verify:
     - Initial text streams until tool suggestion
     - Tool indicator appears with spinning icon
     - Diff preview card shows up
     - Text continues after tool completion

3. **Multiple Message Test**:
   - Send a message that creates a diff preview
   - Without accepting/rejecting, send another message
   - Verify the old preview is auto-accepted and new message streams properly

4. **Preview Resolution Test**:
   - Create a diff preview
   - Accept or reject it
   - Verify the preview card is removed and no lingering state

## Next Steps

If streaming still doesn't work after these fixes:

1. Check browser console for any errors during streaming
2. Verify SignalR connection is established (check debug panel)
3. Look for any React rendering errors
4. Consider implementing the additional reliability improvements from the full plan:
   - Retry logic for state updates
   - Local state in StreamingMessage component
   - Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## Success Indicators

- Streaming text appears immediately (within 500ms)
- No blank/frozen UI during streaming
- Preview cards don't block subsequent messages
- Clean state between messages (no carryover)
