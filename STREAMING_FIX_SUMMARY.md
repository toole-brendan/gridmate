# Streaming Fix Implementation Summary

## Current Status

### âœ… Frontend Changes (Completed)

1. **Updated `useMessageHandlers.ts`**:
   - Added streaming mode detection in `handleToolRequest`
   - Tools execute immediately without preview when streaming
   - Read operations bypass batching in streaming mode
   - Removed duplicate tool handling from `handleStreamChunk`

### âœ… Backend Changes (Partially Completed)

1. **Updated `streaming.go`**:
   - Added streaming mode to context: `ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, "streaming_mode", true)`

2. **Updated `tool_executor.go`**:
   - Added streaming mode detection in `ExecuteTool`
   - Overrides autonomy mode to "full-autonomy" when streaming

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Issues

The main issue is that the backend's streaming flow is still complex and tools are being processed through a queuing mechanism even in streaming mode. The flow is:

1. Backend receives streaming request
2. AI generates tool calls during streaming
3. Tools are executed but return "queued" status
4. Backend detects "queued" status and ends the stream
5. Frontend never receives the tool request through normal channels

## Root Cause

The backend has two parallel flows for tool execution:
1. **Streaming flow**: Tools are executed within the streaming context and results are sent as chunks
2. **Normal flow**: Tools are sent as `tool_request` messages through SignalR

In the current implementation, the streaming flow is trying to execute tools directly, but they're returning "queued" status because of the autonomy mode check in the tool executor.

## Solution

The fix needs to ensure that:
1. In streaming mode, tools are sent through the normal SignalR `tool_request` flow
2. The frontend handles these immediately (already done)
3. The backend waits for the response and continues streaming

## Next Steps

1. **Modify the streaming tool execution** in the backend to send tool requests through SignalR instead of executing directly
2. **Ensure proper response handling** so the stream can continue after tool execution
3. **Test the complete flow** to verify smooth streaming with tool execution

## Expected Behavior

After the complete fix:
- User sends a message that requires tool use
- Backend streams the response
- When a tool is needed, backend sends a `tool_request` through SignalR
- Frontend executes immediately (no preview in streaming mode)
- Frontend sends response back
- Backend continues streaming with tool results
- No stalling, no timeouts, smooth experience like Cursor/Cline
