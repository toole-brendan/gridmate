# Debugging Summary: Backend Data Filtering Issue

## 1. Problem Description

The core issue is a critical performance bottleneck in the backend, where large, unfiltered data payloads are being sent from the Excel `read_range` tool. When the AI requests data from a large spreadsheet range (e.g., `A1:AE110`), the backend reads the entire range, including thousands of empty rows and cells, and sends it as a massive JSON object.

This causes several problems:
- **High Memory Usage**: The large JSON object consumes excessive memory on the backend.
- **Network Overhead**: Sending the large payload consumes unnecessary network bandwidth.
- **Slow Performance**: The time it takes to serialize, send, and deserialize the data leads to application slowdowns and timeouts.
- **Application Instability**: In some cases, this has led to the backend crashing.

## 2. Debugging and Remediation History

The investigation has gone through several phases, each revealing a deeper layer of the problem.

### Attempt 1: Initial Timeout Increase

- **Observation**: The first symptom identified was a `tool request timeout after 30 seconds` error.
- **Action**: The timeout in `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go` was increased from 30 to 300 seconds.
- **Result**: This was a temporary patch that did not solve the underlying performance issue.

### Attempt 2: Filtering in the `ToolExecutor`

- **Plan**: The `BACKEND_PERFORMANCE_AND_STABILITY_FIX_PLAN.md` was created, which proposed adding a `filterEmptyRows` function to reduce the payload size.
- **Implementation**: The filtering logic was incorrectly added to `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/ai/tool_executor_basic_ops.go`.
- **Analysis**: The logs showed that the filtering was happening *after* the data had already been passed through the most performance-critical parts of the system, rendering the optimization ineffective.

### Attempt 3: Relocating the Filtering Logic

- **Plan**: The `BACKEND_FILTERING_FIX_PLAN.md` was created to move the filtering logic to the correct location.
- **Implementation**: The `filterEmptyRows` function was moved to `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go` and called from within the `ReadRange` function.
- **Analysis**: The logs showed that while the filtering function was being called, the unfiltered data was *still* being sent. This was a subtle logic error where the filtered data was not being correctly returned.

### Attempt 4: The "Final" Fix

- **Plan**: The `FINAL_BACKEND_FIX_PLAN.md` was created to correct the logic error from the previous attempt.
- **Implementation**: The filtering logic was moved inside the `sendToolRequest` function in `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go`, ensuring that the data is filtered at the exact moment it is received from the Excel client.
- **Analysis**: The code in `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go` was verified to be correct according to the plan. However, the logs still show the same error, with no evidence of the filtering function being called.

## 3. Current Status and Hypothesis

The code in `/Users/brendantoole/projects2/gridmate/backend/internal/services/excel/excel_bridge_impl.go` appears to be correct, yet the application is behaving as if the changes were never made.

This strongly suggests that the issue is not with the code itself, but with the build process. It is highly likely that a cached, outdated version of the compiled code is being executed, which does not include the latest fixes.

The next step is to force a clean build to ensure that the latest code is running.
