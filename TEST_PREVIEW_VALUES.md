# Testing Preview Values Display Fix

## Setup
1. Start the development environment: `./start-dev.sh`
2. Open Excel with the Gridmate add-in
3. Have the browser console open to see logs

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Single Cell Value Change
1. Enter "Old Value" in cell A1
2. In Gridmate, request AI to change A1 to "New Value"
3. **Expected during preview**:
   - Cell A1 shows "New Value" (not "Old Value")
   - Text appears in italic font
   - Cell has appropriate background color
4. Click **Accept**:
   - Italic formatting removed
   - "New Value" remains
   - Background color removed
5. Or click **Reject**:
   - Cell returns to "Old Value"
   - All formatting removed

### Test Case 2: Multi-Cell Range (2D Array)
1. Enter data in A1:C3 (3x3 grid)
2. Request AI to update all cells with new values
3. **Expected during preview**:
   - All 9 cells show new values
   - All values in italic font
   - Appropriate highlighting colors
4. Test Accept/Reject as above

### Test Case 3: Formula Application
1. Enter numbers in A1:A10
2. Request AI to add formula "=SUM(A1:A10)" in B1
3. **Expected during preview**:
   - B1 shows calculated result in italic
   - Formula bar shows the formula
4. Test Accept/Reject

### Test Case 4: Mixed Operations Batch
1. Set up data in multiple cells
2. Request AI to:
   - Change some values
   - Add formulas
   - Clear some cells
3. **Expected**: All preview values display correctly with italic formatting

## Console Log Verification

Look for these key log messages:

### Successful Preview
- `[info] [Simulator] Writing to X cells`
- `[info] [Visualizer] Set preview value for Sheet1!A1: New Value`
- NO warnings about "Skipping array value"

### Previous Bug Indicators
- `[warn] [Visualizer] Skipping array value for single cell` - This should NOT appear anymore

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Values not showing**: Check console for array skipping warnings
2. **No italic formatting**: Verify GridVisualizer changes were applied
3. **Values disappear on accept**: Check preserveValues parameter is true
4. **Array data in single cells**: Verify diffSimulator fix is working

## Performance Notes
- Preview should complete within 3 seconds
- No Excel crashes or freezes
- Memory usage should remain stable
