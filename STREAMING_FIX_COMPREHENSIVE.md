# Comprehensive Streaming Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis

The streaming implementation is failing because:

1. **Tool Request Flow Mismatch**: 
   - Backend sends tool requests during streaming and waits for responses
   - Frontend was designed for preview-based sequential tool execution
   - In streaming mode, this creates a deadlock where both sides are waiting

2. **Stream Stalling**:
   - Browser logs show stream stalls after receiving text chunks
   - Backend logs show timeout errors when forwarding tool responses
   - The SignalR connection times out after 100 seconds

3. **Mode Detection**:
   - Frontend needs to detect streaming mode and handle tools differently
   - Backend needs to know when to skip preview mode in streaming context

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Frontend Changes (Already Applied)

âœ… **Updated `handleToolRequest` in `useMessageHandlers.ts`**:
- Added streaming mode detection by checking for active streaming messages
- In streaming mode, tools execute immediately without preview
- Read operations also execute immediately in streaming mode
- Prevents batching and queuing in streaming context

âœ… **Updated `handleStreamChunk`**:
- Removed duplicate tool execution logic
- Tool requests now flow through the normal `tool_request` handler

### 2. Backend Changes Needed

The backend needs to be updated to handle streaming mode properly:

```go
// In tool_executor.go ExecuteTool function
// Add streaming mode detection from context
isStreamingMode := false
if streaming, ok := ctx.Value("streaming_mode").(bool); ok {
    isStreamingMode = streaming
}

// Override autonomy mode for streaming
effectiveAutonomyMode := autonomyMode
if isStreamingMode && autonomyMode == "agent-default" {
    // Force immediate execution in streaming mode
    effectiveAutonomyMode = "full-autonomy"
}
```

### 3. SignalR Bridge Updates

The SignalR bridge needs to handle streaming tool requests differently:

```go
// In signalr_bridge.go
// Add streaming flag to tool requests
toolRequest["streaming_mode"] = true
```

### 4. Streaming Context Propagation

The streaming handler needs to propagate streaming context:

```go
// In streaming.go handler
ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, "streaming_mode", true)
```

## Testing Plan

1. **Basic Streaming Test**:
   - Send a message that triggers tool use
   - Verify tools execute immediately without preview
   - Check that responses flow back correctly

2. **Multiple Tool Test**:
   - Send a request that triggers multiple tools
   - Verify all tools execute in sequence
   - No deadlocks or timeouts

3. **Mixed Mode Test**:
   - Test streaming and non-streaming messages in same session
   - Verify correct mode detection and handling

## Implementation Priority

1. âœ… Frontend streaming detection and immediate execution (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Backend streaming context propagation (NEXT)
3. ðŸ”„ Tool executor streaming mode handling
4. ðŸ”„ SignalR bridge streaming flag
5. ðŸ”„ Testing and validation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Streaming messages with tools will execute immediately
- No preview UI in streaming mode
- Tools complete and stream continues without stalling
- Backend doesn't wait for preview approval in streaming mode
- Smooth, uninterrupted streaming experience like Cursor/Cline
